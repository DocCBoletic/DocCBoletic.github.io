Seventeen (Korean: 세븐틴) is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has conquered a large audience since its debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances.

Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances. They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.

The name Seventeen is derived from the expression "13 members + 3 units + 1 group", representing how the 13 members are divided into three different units and come together to form one cohesive group. The name *originally* referred to how 17 members (with the other 4 former pre-debut trainees — Jang Do-yoon, Samuel Kim, Shin Dong-jin, and Yao Mingming) planned to debut.

The name of their fandom is Carat. On February 5 ~ February 12, 2016, SEVENTEEN created a poll on their official website, where fans could vote for one of the six candidates, TINKER BELL, TINVELY, WISH, SAME, WENNIE, and CARAT.

On February 14, 2016, Seventeen held an exclusive concert 'LIKE SEVENTEEN - Boys Wish' where they revealed their official fan club name, following their performances for "Rock," "NO F.U.N" and "Mansae." Once the performance was over, Leader S.Coups said, "We have an announcement. You guys made us shine so bright. So you guys are now going to be our CARAT."

The group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" list. Seventeen has released four studio albums, twelve EPs, and three reissues.

Again, Seventeen is composed of 13 members, who are divided into three groups; **The Vocal Group**, **The Performance Group**, and **The Hip-Hop Group**. Each group has a leader but is still also led by one leader.

## The Hip-Hop Group

The Hip-Hop Group contains 4 of the 13 members of Seventeen, namely; S.Coups, Wonwoo, Mingyu, and Vernon. They mainly handle the rap or the fast part of the song but they still have powerful vocals and amazing performances. Let's get to know them one by one!

## **S.Coups**

**S.Coups** (Korean: 에스쿱스) aka Choi Seungcheol (Korean: 최승철) was born on August 8, 1995. He is 28 years old and the official leader of SEVENTEEN. He is the oldest member and one of the main rappers. He is part of the HIP-HOP sub-team. 

His name S.Coups comes from the combination of the first initial of his real name Seungcheol and also of Seventeen (S), and the word COUPS from the French word coup d'etat.

## **Wonwoo**

**Wonwoo** (Korean: 원우) aka Jeon Wonwoo (Korean: 전원우) was born on July 17, 1996. He is 27 years old and one of the sub-rappers of SEVENTEEN. He is part of the HIP-HOP team.

When he was in middle school, he had an interest to learn to play the guitar so he joined a music academy with his friend as a hobby. Pledis Entertainment was, coincidentally, holding an audition there and Wonwoo passed.

## **Mingyu**

## **The Performance Group**

The Performance Group contains another 4 of the 13 members of Seventeen, namely; Hoshi, Jun, Mighao, and Dino. Their niche is doing the dancing part or the performance parts of the song. They are great dancers and mainly focus on it but they also exhibit wonderful vocals and can also show a great performance in rap too. Let's get to know them one by one!
