Seventeen (Korean: ÏÑ∏Î∏êÌã¥) is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has conquered a large audience since its debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances.

Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances. They perform as one group and are divided into three units‚Äîhip-hop, vocal, and performance‚Äîeach with a different area of specialization. They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.

The name Seventeen is derived from the expression "13 members + 3 units + 1 group", representing how the 13 members are divided into three different units and come together to form one cohesive group. The name *originally* referred to how 17 members (with the other 4 former pre-debut trainees ‚Äî Jang Do-yoon, Samuel Kim, Shin Dong-jin, and Yao Mingming) planned to debut.

The name of their fandom is Carat. On February 5 ~ February 12, 2016, SEVENTEEN created a poll on their official website, where fans could vote for one of the six candidates, TINKER BELL, TINVELY, WISH, SAME, WENNIE, and CARAT.

On February 14, 2016, Seventeen held an exclusive concert 'LIKE SEVENTEEN - Boys Wish' where they revealed their official fan club name, following their performances for "Rock," "NO F.U.N" and "Mansae." Once the performance was over, Leader S.Coups said, "We have an announcement. You guys made us shine so bright. So you guys are now going to be our CARAT."

The group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" list. Seventeen has released four studio albums, twelve EPs and three reissues.
